# Color-Sorting-Robotic-Arm
The Color Sorting Robotic Arm is an automated system that detects and sorts objects based on color using an ESP32, servo motors, and a TCS3200 sensor. It picks up objects with a gripper and places them in bins, improving efficiency and accuracy in sorting tasks. Applications include industrial automation, waste management, and food processing.
